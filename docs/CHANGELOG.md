# Changelog

## 26.5.2d — 2026-05-08

### Changed
- spotter(viz): VizBlock now uses real ECharts (echarts-for-react) instead of an SVG sketch. Pulls from the shared chart palette (`_shared/tiles/chartPalette`) so colors, fonts, and axis styling match the rest of the project's charts. Supports `line` / `bar` / `pie` / `table` from the schema with axis labels, gridlines, tooltips, value labels on bars, and a top legend for multi-series
- spotter(viz): M4 expand modal — portaled to `document.body` to escape any ancestor containing block, full-width override (`max-width: none`), proper layout with chart title + view toggle + tokens + chart + "Showing X of X data points" footer

### Fixed
- spotter(chat): streaming keyframes (blockIn, reasoningIn, stepIn, workedForIn) end with `transform: none` instead of `translateY(0)` — translate(0) still creates a containing block per CSS spec, which had trapped Modal's `position: fixed` to the chat canvas

## 26.5.2c — 2026-05-08

### Changed
- spotter(chat): streaming animation polish — six fixes to make the live agent message feel smooth instead of poppy
  - Step dot color transitions smoothly between gray / brand / gray as `reasoning_step` chunks fire
  - New blocks (viz, followups, sources) fade up on entry instead of popping
  - Steps container collapses via `max-height + opacity` (no unmount), so the auto-collapse 600ms after done animates instead of jumping
  - Toolcall body slides open via `max-height + opacity` instead of conditional render
  - `ReasoningBlock` only renders once reasoning is set — cleaner crossfade from TypingIndicator
  - "Worked for X seconds" fades up with a 120ms delay instead of popping
- spotter(chat): ReasoningBlock keeps steps + toolcall bodies mounted across collapse cycles so re-open is instant and collapse is animated

## 26.5.2b — 2026-05-07

### Added
- feat(spotter): chat extraction end-to-end — SpotterChatProvider + useReducer + AbortController, ChatThread, MessageRow, UserBubble (single-row), AgentMessage with feedback row, TypingIndicator (spinner + "Analysing…"), ReasoningBlock with rich steps (descriptions + embedded ToolcallCard, "Worked for X seconds")
- feat(spotter): streaming runtime — AnswerChunk protocol, askSpotter() async generator (canned + live shell), 4 fixtures with naive keyword routing (viz default)
- feat(spotter): six block renderers — TextBlock, VizBlock (slot model with iframe / data / placeholder, canonical footer, chart/table toggle, expand modal), SourcesBlock, FollowUpsBlock (clickable chips), RefineBlock, ErrorBlock
- feat(spotter): smooth 64↔260 panel animation via SpotterLeftSide wrapper
- feat(spotter): purple→blue gradient border on SpotterPrompt :focus-within
- feat(spotter): custom PanelToggle icon (Figma path), ChartSearch + Orbits glyphs for prompt mode toggle
- feat(prototype): Spotter prototype now wraps in SpotterChatProvider; welcome ↔ chat-active transition with sticky prompt and disclaimer
- docs(spotter): VizBlock behaviour doc; three .cursor/rules files (components, logic, response-style) with auto-attach globs; Spotter Requirements Gate in _orchestration.md; CLAUDE.md two-layer DS section

### Changed
- spotter(panel): full-width selected state on items, full-width line breaks between sections (per Figma)
- spotter(reasoning): brand-blue trigger when expanded, gray done dots, ToolcallCard collapsed by default with "Show details" link
- spotter(viz): schema discriminated union with `source: iframe | data | placeholder` + optional `tableData`

## 26.5.2a — 2026-05-07

### Added
- feat(spotter): `@spotter/*` peer to `@components/*` — two-layer DS scaffold for Spotter-domain building blocks layered on Radiant
- feat(spotter): chat primitives — QuickAction, QuickActionRow, SpotterPrompt (controlled, auto-resize, mode toggle, model picker, blue submit)
- feat(spotter): page primitives — SpotterShell, SpotterLeftSide, SpotterRail/Item, SpotterPanel/Section/Item/Action, SpotterWelcome
- feat(spotter): smooth 64↔260 width animation between collapsed rail and expanded panel
- feat(spotter): spotter tokens (radial glow + chart-bg aliases) and spotter icons (PanelToggle, Bell, ThoughtSpotMark, ChartSearch, Orbits) — only glyphs missing from Radiant registry
- feat(prototype): Spotter prototype — first DS consumer with light-mode GlobalHeader and welcome canvas
- docs(spotter): four plan docs covering the two-layer DS, prototype shell, AnswerCard spec, and chat extraction approach

## 26.5.2 — 2026-05-07

### Added
- docs(muze): `docs/muze-charts-setup.md` — opt-in guide for adding Muze charts (auth, install, chart-shape cheatsheet, resize-aware mounting). Default install stays friction-free for designers who don't use Muze

### Changed
- refactor(LiveboardHeader): unify dark surfaces and tokenize raw hex values
- fix(radiant-pages): bump content-tertiary to content-secondary for readability
- chore(components): remove duplicate exports of LoadingIndicator, Popover, Select from components/index.ts

### Removed
- chore(pages): delete 5 unrouted page components (ComponentStatusPage, DataDashboardDemo, GuidelinesPage, SettingsPanelDemo, SpotterDashboard) — ~2,400 lines of dead code never wired into App.tsx

## 26.5.1 — 2026-05-05

### Removed
- chore(prototypes): SalesDashboard prototype removed from the registry — reference patterns continue to live in `_liveboard-template`
- chore(prototypes): SpotterModel standalone prototype removed — patterns now covered by DataModelEditor + the shared `_agentic` module
- revert(prototype): PR #14 (StylingPanel + shared tile density/override system) reverted on staging due to integration issues; will be re-introduced in a follow-up PR

## 26.5.0 — 2026-04-30

- feat(prototype): SpotterModel agent panel — AI-powered chat interface with table, join, column, and formula suggestions backed by Anthropic
- feat(prototypes): shared `_agentic` module — AgentPanel, SuggestionCard, ReasoningBlock, ConfidenceBadge, JoinDiagram, NextActionChips, ToolcallCard, TypingIndicator, UserBubble, VersionCard, AgentResponseBlock
- feat(prototypes): shared `_datamodel` module — TableCanvas, ColumnTree, JoinConnector, TableCard
- feat(infra): `/api/chat` proxy for the Anthropic API (Vercel function + Vite dev middleware)
- feat(ds): OverlayLoading variant + label props (backwards-compatible)
- feat(tooling): `/switch-model` command — switch the Claude model used by AI-capable prototypes between Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus
- docs(rules): three new orchestrator rule files — `data-model-editor-ia.md`, `data-model-editor-components.md`, `data-model-editor-interactions.md`
- docs(orchestrator): "AI agent panel (any prototype)" fallback row so non-DME prototypes can adopt `_agentic`

### Changed
- chore(orchestrator): split the single DME concern row into three sub-rows (IA / components / interactions) so the right rule file loads per task
- chore(tooling): `new-prototype` command updated for DME-style scaffolding
- chore(tooling): status.sh untracked-files badge

### Fixed
- fix(infra): vite middleware now reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` via `loadEnv` — `process.env` was empty in dev and the AI panel errored

## [26.4.4b] - 2026-04-28

### Token system Figma alignment (Phases 1–5 of 8, dark mode out of scope)

#### Phase 4 — Elevation / Shadows

- New `shadowPrimitives` with 3 semantic levels matched to Figma: `surface` (Card, Tooltip, Nav), `menu` (Dropdown, Popover, Sidebar overlay), `modal` (Modal, Dialog)
- Light mode uses colored ink tints (`#192331`); dark mode uses pure black for cool dark base
- New CSS variables `--shadow-surface`, `--shadow-menu`, `--shadow-modal` with light/dark theme variants
- Component CSS migrated from legacy `--shadow-xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl` (kept as aliases) to semantic vars: Modal, Tooltip, Popover, Card, Menu, DatePicker, FilterModal, InputMentions, AppSidebar overlay
- Modal hardcoded RGBA box-shadow replaced with `var(--shadow-modal)` (token-only compliance)

#### Phase 5 — Layout constants

- `AppSidebar.tsx` and `AppShell.tsx` default sidebar width `261px → 260px` (Figma rounding alignment)
- Header height stays `60px`, content max width `1280px` — `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursor/rules/layout-patterns.md` already reflect these (no doc updates needed)

### Token system Figma alignment (Phases 1–3 of 8)

Plan: `plans/2026-04-07-token-system-implementation.md`

#### Phase 1 — Primitive colors

- **darkGray scale** (12 stops) added to `referenceColors` — neutral foundation for Phase 6 dark mode remap
- **Alpha variants** added: `gray-70a/60a/40a/10a`, `blue-10a`, `dark-gray-30a`
- **Hex fixes** to match Figma: `purple/70` `#6847BA → #6A4ABA`, `purple/100` `#0D0030 → #0E0033`, `teal/70` `#359FAA → #369FAA`
- New primitives exposed in `tokens.css` as `--rd-ref-color-dark-gray-*` and `--rd-ref-color-*a`

#### Phase 2 — Light mode semantic colors

- **6 value fixes**: `content-tertiary`, `border-focus`, `border-hover`, `background-overlay`, `background-ghost-highlight`, `background-base-inverse`
- **22 new tokens**: 9 background-accent-*, 6 content-accent-*, 7 border-* (subtle-hover + 6 accents), `background-on-base`, `background-active`
- Same keys added to dark object as placeholders (Phase 6 will remap properly)
- Phase 2.5 (deprecate 25 extra RP tokens) deferred — list not enumerated

#### Phase 3 — Typography

- `letterSpacing.tight`: `-0.01em → -0.4px` (Figma absolute)
- `letterSpacing.tighter`: new (`-0.6px`)
- 6 v2TextStyles weights `medium → semibold`: headlineLarge, pageTitle, modalTitle, sectionLabel, contentLabel, contentLabelSubhead
- pageTitle/modalTitle: `letterSpacing.normal → tight`
- footnote/caption/overline: `letterSpacing → tighter`
- `textStyles.body.large/normal`: `light (375) → regular (400)`

## [26.4.4a] - 2026-04-27

### Modal alignment with Figma (absorbed RdModal PR)

- **Header**: padding restored to `20px 24px` (variable height) so wizard variants grow correctly for eyebrow + title
- **Footer**: fixed at 72px height with `0 24px` padding; CTA placement bug fixed (tertiary-left / primary-right now sit at correct edges — was double-wrapped)
- **Wizard stepper**: rebuilt as discrete 4px segments with 6px gap and 2px radii; also renders for `splashscreen` type to enable onboarding flows
- **Close button**: removed X icon from M1/M2/M3 simple modals — only M4 keeps the "Close" text link, per Figma
- **Splash screen**: header no longer renders (title lives in body via `ModalSplashContent`)
- **Overlay z-index**: bumped to 1000 so M4 covers the sidebar

### Surfaces showcase additions

- New M2 eyebrow-only variant (no stepper)
- New M2 splash-screen-multi (3-step onboarding flow with stepper)
- Wizard footer keeps Back rendered (disabled on step 1) + primary button uses `minWidth: spacing.I*2` so position stays consistent across steps
- Spec card updated to Figma values; secondary/primary demo swatches use `content-primary` / `content-alternate` tokens

### LastUpdated component

- New shared component reads `lastModified` from `componentRegistry` (or accepts a manual date)
- Added at top of Surfaces, Icons, Architecture, and ComponentDocPage
- Modal registry entry refreshed with current Figma node ID and `2026-04-27` sync date

---

## [26.4.1c] - 2026-04-08

### Fork architecture

- **Registry split**: Monolith `registry.ts` split into `registry-core.ts` (upstream) + `registry-mine.ts` (designer) + thin merger — eliminates merge conflicts for all designer forks
- **Skills and docs updated**: `sync-upstream`, `check-upstream`, `new-prototype`, `prototype-structure`, `FORK-WORKFLOW` all reference new 3-file registry architecture
- **Self-documenting migration**: Migration note in `registry-mine.ts` guides any Claude instance through first-time conflict resolution

### AI orchestrator

- **Orchestrator tier system**: Intent-based classification (Tier 0–3) with concern-matching table — 81% context reduction for median tasks
- **Pre-implementation gate**: 4 checks before code (component exists, CSS anti-patterns, icon name, forbidden words)
- **Iteration loop detection**: Suggests batching after 3+ sequential single-property changes
- **MCP overhead awareness**: Flags Figma MCP ~4,000 token overhead when idle
- **Context budget check**: Proactive `/compact` suggestion on topic switches
- **Session memory**: Tracks loaded rule files to prevent redundant reads

### Liveboard system

- **Canvas 3-tier split**: Monolithic `liveboard-canvas.md` (568 lines) → core (242), edit (238), advanced (100) with prerequisite chains
- **Requirements gate**: 4-question pre-build gate (mode, interactions, tile types, data) before loading canvas context
- **UserPromptSubmit hooks**: Liveboard intent detection + post-compact convention recovery (~200 tokens/msg)
- **Shared tiles**: `_shared/tiles/` with AnswerTile, ChartRenderer, and 12 chart types
- **SalesDashboard prototype**: Liveboard prototype with view/edit modes and SpotterViz panel

### Platform and tooling

- **Deployment password gate**: Edge middleware password-gates Vercel deployments — opt-in per designer via `SITE_PASSWORD` env var in their Vercel dashboard
- **CalVer versioning**: `platformVersion.ts` as single source of truth; version badge on homepage, playground, and DS sidebar
- **Component source badges**: Figma / Scaligent / Custom badge on every component doc page
- **Release tooling**: `scripts/release.sh`, pre-push hook, `install-maintainer-hooks.sh`
- **6 Claude Code skills**: Auto-activating with `globs` frontmatter (component-inventory, content-guidelines, token-usage, layout-patterns, widget-patterns, modal-patterns)
- **CLAUDE.md trimmed 36%** (210 → 135 lines) — detailed guidelines moved to on-demand skills

### UI and performance

- **Homepage polish**: Space blue title, subtle card icons, shortened descriptions, footer easter egg
- **ECharts lazy-loaded**: 1.18 MB chunk deferred from startup to first chart render
- **All DS pages centred**: maxWidth 1200px in RadiantLayout

### Bug fixes and security

- **0 TypeScript errors**: Icon name, TileMode import, NoteTileProps, unused variables all resolved
- **Avatar contrast**: Light background tokens swapped for saturated content tokens
- **Vite 7.3.2**: High severity vulnerability patched
- **Picomatch**: Vulnerability patched, Figma Make package.json removed
- **ConfirmDialog**: Non-Radiant gradient override removed
- **Button examples**: All now include `iconPosition` prop

### Cleanup

- **Cmdk prototype gitignored**: 11 MB Figma Make export removed from designer forks
- **Orphaned prototypes deleted**: Homepage_example, ImpersonationV2, Liveboard, ModalPatterns
- **Documentation updated**: README, SETUP-GUIDE, Onepager, prototyping-guide refreshed with current counts

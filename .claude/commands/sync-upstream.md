Sync this fork with the latest changes from the upstream main repo (galaxy: mohammed-faris/radiantplay).

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order. Stop immediately if any step fails and explain what went wrong.

---

### 1. Save in-progress work

Run `git status`.

- If the working tree is clean — proceed to step 2.
- If there are modified or untracked files — auto-stash them:
  ```
  git stash push -m "radiant-sync-wip"
  ```
  Print: **"Saved your in-progress work. It will be restored after the sync."**

Do NOT ask the designer about stashes or require any git knowledge. This is handled automatically.

Remember whether a stash was created — you will need to restore it at the end (step 9).

---

### 2. Check upstream remote

Run `git remote -v`.

- If `upstream` is listed — proceed to step 3.
- If `upstream` is missing — add it using HTTPS first, fall back to SSH if fetch fails:
  ```
  git remote add upstream https://galaxy.corp.thoughtspot.com/mohammed-faris/radiantplay.git
  ```
  Run `git fetch upstream`. If it fails with a 403 or authentication error, switch to SSH:
  ```
  git remote set-url upstream git@galaxy.corp.thoughtspot.com:mohammed-faris/radiantplay.git
  ```

---

### 3. Fetch upstream

```
git fetch upstream
```

---

### 4. Show what is coming

Run:
```
git log --oneline HEAD..upstream/main
```

Print the result to the user with a brief summary:
- How many commits behind they are
- One-line summary of the most significant changes (new components, deleted files, etc.)

If the output is empty, print:
```
Already up to date with upstream. Nothing to merge.
```
If a stash was created in step 1, restore it now: `git stash pop`
Then stop — there is nothing to do.

---

### 5. Merge upstream

```
git merge upstream/main
```

Two outcomes:

**A — Clean merge (no conflicts)**
Git prints `Merge made by the 'ort' strategy`. Proceed directly to step 7.

**B — Conflict**
Git prints `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/prototypes/registry.ts`.
This is expected — proceed to step 6.

If the conflict is in any file OTHER than `src/prototypes/registry.ts`, stop and explain what conflicted and why before attempting to resolve it.

---

### 6. Resolve the `registry.ts` conflict

Read `src/prototypes/registry.ts` and find all conflict marker blocks (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

For each conflict block:

1. **Identify upstream entries** — the block after `=======` up to `>>>>>>>`. These are new sample prototypes added to the main repo. Keep all of them exactly as-is.

2. **Identify the designer's entries** — the block between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`. These are the designer's own prototype registrations. Keep all of them.

3. **Merge the two blocks** — write the final result with:
   - All upstream entries first (in their original order)
   - The designer's entries after, at the bottom
   - Delete the three marker lines entirely (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)

4. **Add `section: 'mine'`** — for every designer entry that does not already have a `section` field, add `section: 'mine'` as the last property in that object.

After editing, read the file back and confirm there are no remaining `<<<<<<<` markers.

Then:
```
git add src/prototypes/registry.ts
git commit
```

Accept the default merge commit message (do not modify it).

---

### 7. Verify the build

```
npm run build
```

- If it succeeds — proceed to step 8.
- If it fails — read the error output carefully.

**Common post-merge build errors and fixes:**

| Error pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Cannot find module './<Name>'` in registry.ts | A prototype was removed upstream but the lazy import still references it. Remove the `const <Name> = React.lazy(...)` line and its registry entry. |
| `Cannot find module` in an index or barrel file | An export references a deleted file. Remove the broken export line. |
| TypeScript error in designer's own prototype files | This is unrelated to the sync — flag it to the designer and proceed with the push anyway. |

After fixing, re-run `npm run build` to confirm it passes before continuing.

---

### 8. Push to fork

Push the synced state to the designer's remote:

```
git push origin main
```

This is a mandatory step — the sync is not complete until the remote fork is updated.

---

### 9. Restore in-progress work

If a stash was created in step 1, restore it now:

```
git stash pop
```

- If the pop succeeds cleanly — proceed to the report.
- If there are conflicts — tell the designer which files conflicted and help resolve them. These are conflicts between their in-progress work and the upstream changes.

If no stash was created in step 1, skip this step.

---

### 10. Report

Print a summary in this format:

```
Synced with upstream!

Pulled in X commits:
  • <one-line summary of most important changes>
  • <one-line summary>
  ...

Your prototype: intact — src/prototypes/<name>/ was not touched.
registry.ts: conflict resolved — your entry preserved with section: 'mine'.

Your fork is now up to date.
```

If there was nothing to sync:
```
Already up to date — no changes from upstream.
```

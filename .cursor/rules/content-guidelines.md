# ThoughtSpot UX Writing Rules

Apply these rules as **hard constraints** to ALL user-facing text in UI components, prototypes, and mock data.

**Full ruleset (79 rules):** [docs/ux-writing-rules.md](docs/ux-writing-rules.md)
**Detailed reference:** [docs/content-guidelines-detailed.md](docs/content-guidelines-detailed.md)

---

## Rule Application Process

Before generating ANY user-facing string, follow this sequence:

1. **Identify the element type** — button, title, label, alert, toast, tooltip, error, descriptive text, input field, explain card, splash modal, or spotlight
2. **Apply the matching constraints** from the table below
3. **Apply brand voice rules** — approachable, not casual; clear over clever
4. **Apply terminology rules** — exact capitalization of ThoughtSpot features
5. **Validate** — check character limits, word counts, casing, punctuation, and approved word list

|---|---|
| **Max length** | 1-2 words |

| **Checkbox/required controls** | 2-5 words, clear remedy |

### Alerts

| **Toast alerts** | 4-6 words. May use congratulatory language (Success, Nice). |
| **Alert dialogs** | Primary button repeats title's imperative verb. Secondary button is almost always Cancel. |

|---|---|
| **Max line length** | 40 characters |
| **Max lines** | 4 lines (hard break if longer) |
| **Structure** | Action before outcome — start with imperative verbs |

| **Create** | Making a NEW object that did not previously exist | Create Liveboard |
| **Add** | Putting an EXISTING item into a container | Add filter |
| **Delete** | Erasing something FOREVER from the system | Delete Answer |
| **Remove** | Taking something away; it still exists and can be restored | Remove from Liveboard |

## Brand Voice

The ThoughtSpot voice is the intersection of four attributes:

| Attribute | Means | Does NOT mean |
|---|---|---|
| **Approachable** | Genuine, humble, friendly, plain language | Overly casual |
| **Pioneering** | Visionary, innovative, trailblazing | Risky or intimidating |
| **Smart** | Insightful, trusted, sharp | Pushy or arrogant |
| **Provocative** | Thought-provoking, compelling, challenging | Overbearing or contentious |

### Tone Adaptation

- **Errors / bad news** — More practical, direct, blame-free
- **Success / empty states** — Can be quirkier, playful, encouraging
- **Default** — Always err on clarity and simplicity over cleverness

### Voice Rules

- Use **active voice** in most cases
- Use **passive voice** only to soften negative messages (e.g., "Account disabled" vs "We disabled your account")
- Use **contractions** (don't, can't, we'll) for conversational tone
- Use **present tense** to describe results ("Object added" not "Object has been added")

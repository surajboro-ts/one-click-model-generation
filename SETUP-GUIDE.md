# Radiant Play — Setup & Usage Guide

Build interactive prototypes with AI assistance using ThoughtSpot's Radiant design system.

---

## Prerequisites (one-time installs)

### 1. Install Node.js

- Go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Download the **LTS** version (18 or higher)
- Run the installer, accept all defaults
- To verify, open any terminal and type:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see `v18.x.x` or higher.

### 2. Install Cursor IDE

- Go to [https://cursor.so](https://cursor.so)
- Download and install for your OS (Mac/Windows)
- Open it once to complete initial setup

---

## Getting Started (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Unzip the file

- Unzip `radiantplay.zip` to a location you'll remember (e.g., Desktop or Documents)
- You'll get a folder called `radiantplay/`

### Step 2: Open in Cursor

- Open Cursor IDE
- Go to **File > Open Folder**
- Select the `radiantplay` folder
- Cursor will load the project and automatically pick up the AI rules

### Step 3: Open the terminal

- In Cursor, open the built-in terminal: **Terminal > New Terminal** (or press `` Ctrl+` ``)

### Step 4: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- This downloads all required packages (~74MB). Takes 1–2 minutes.
- You only need to do this **once**.

### Step 5: Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

- You'll see a message like: `Local: http://localhost:5173`
- Open that URL in your browser (Chrome recommended)
- You should see the Radiant Play welcome page

> **Leave this terminal running** — it watches for changes and updates the browser automatically.

---

## Creating Your First Prototype

### Step 6: Create a new prototype

Open a **second terminal** in Cursor (click the `+` icon in the terminal panel) and run:

```bash
npm run new-prototype MyPrototypeName
```

This creates a starter file at `src/prototypes/MyPrototypeName/index.tsx`.

### Step 7: Ask Cursor AI to build your UI

- Open the new `index.tsx` file
- Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows) to open inline AI edit, or use the **Chat panel** on the right
- Describe what you want. Example prompts:

> "Create a user onboarding wizard with 3 steps: welcome screen, profile form with name and email, and notification preferences with toggles. Include a progress stepper at the top and Next/Back buttons."

> "Build a data dashboard with 4 KPI cards at the top, a tab bar switching between Chart and Table views, and a data table with user name, email, and status columns."

> "Recreate this UI using Radiant components" *(paste a Figma screenshot)*

The AI already knows all 74 Radiant components, design tokens, and patterns thanks to the built-in `.cursor/rules/`.

### Step 8: Preview in browser

After the AI generates code, your browser at `http://localhost:5173` updates automatically. Navigate to the Playground to see your prototype listed.

### Step 9: Iterate

Ask the AI to refine:

- "Make the sidebar narrower"
- "Add a search input above the table"
- "Change the primary button to secondary"

Each change appears instantly in the browser.

## Daily Workflow

Each time you come back to work:

1. Open the `radiantplay` folder in Cursor
2. Open terminal and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
4. Start building or editing prototypes with AI

## Tips for Better Results

| Tip | Example |
|-----|---------|
| **Name specific components** | "Use a `Modal` with a `SearchInput` and `Checkbox` list" |
| **Describe layout** | "Sidebar on the left, content area on the right" |
| **Describe interactions** | "Clicking the row opens a detail panel" |
| **Paste Figma screenshots** | Drop an image in the chat and say "Recreate this" |
| **Reference existing prototypes** | "Similar to the AdminGroups prototype" |
| **Use mock data** | "Use the mock user data for the table" |

---

## Using Mock Data

Import realistic sample data for your prototypes:

```tsx
import { users, analytics, navigation, forms } from '../../mocks';
```

| Data | What's included |
|------|----------------|
| `users.profiles` | Array of user objects with name, email, role |
| `users.groups` | User groups |
| `analytics.metrics` | KPI card data |
| `analytics.revenueByMonth` | Chart data |
| `navigation.sidebar` | Main nav items |
| `navigation.settingsSidebar` | Settings nav items |
| `forms.countries` | Country dropdown options |
| `forms.departments` | Department options |
| `forms.timeRanges` | Time period options |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `npm install` fails | Make sure Node.js is installed: run `node --version` |
| `npm run dev` fails | Delete the `node_modules` folder, then run `npm install` again |
| Browser shows blank page | Check the terminal for errors — usually a typo in code |
| AI doesn't know components | Make sure you opened the `radiantplay` folder (not a parent folder) so Cursor loads the rules |
| Port 5173 already in use | Close other dev servers, or the terminal will show an alternate port |
| Changes not showing in browser | Make sure `npm run dev` is still running in the terminal |

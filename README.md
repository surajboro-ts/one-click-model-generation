# Radiant Play

A tool-agnostic prototyping playground built on ThoughtSpot's Radiant design system. Describe what you want, and your AI tool of choice builds it with real components, real tokens, and real interactions.

## What is this?

Radiant Play is a fork-ready repository for ThoughtSpot designers, PMs, and anyone building product prototypes. It ships with 120+ Radiant UI components, design tokens, mock data, and an AI rule system — so you can describe a UI in plain language and get working, compliant code in seconds.

Works with any AI coding tool: **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Codex**, or any tool that reads project-level instructions.

---

## Getting started

### Option 1 — With Git (recommended)

```bash
# Fork on GitHub or Galaxy, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/radiantplay.git
cd radiantplay
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 2 — Without Git

Download the ZIP from GitHub (`Code → Download ZIP`), extract it, then:

```bash
cd radiantplay-main
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Create your first prototype

```bash
npm run new-prototype MyPrototype
```

Open `src/prototypes/MyPrototype/index.tsx` in your AI tool and describe your UI. The AI reads the project rules automatically and builds with Radiant components.

---

## How the AI system works

This is the part that makes Radiant Play different from a blank React repo.

### The orchestrator

At the centre is `_orchestration.md` — a routing layer that classifies every request by intent before loading any rule files. It reads what you're trying to do and decides which instruction files the AI needs.

### Task classification (tiers)

Every request is classified into one of four tiers:

| Tier | Intent | Example | Rules loaded |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **0 — Minor tweak** | Fix a value, swap a prop, adjust padding | "Change the button label to Save" | None — base instructions are enough |
| **1 — Moderate change** | Add a section, modal, table, or interaction | "Add a delete confirmation dialog" | 1–3 files matched by concern |
| **2 — Full build** | New prototype from scratch or from Figma | "Build a settings page with sidebar" | Mandatory files + concern-matched extras |
| **3 — Design system** | Create or modify a shared component | "Add a closable prop to the Chip component" | Fixed set of 4 design system files |

This means a minor colour fix loads ~85% less context than it would if everything loaded upfront. For a typical design day of small tweaks and moderate changes, that's roughly a **60–70% reduction in AI overhead**.

### Concern-matching

Tier 1 tasks are routed through a concern table — the AI loads only the files relevant to what the task involves:

| Concern | Rule file |
|---------|-----------|
| Page layout, grids, sidebars | `layout-patterns.md` |
| Tables, alerts, menus, toasts | `widget-patterns.md` |
| Modals, dialogs, wizards | `modal-patterns.md` |
| Loading, error, empty states | `interaction-patterns.md` |
| Colors, spacing, CSS variables | `token-usage.md` |
| UI copy, labels, buttons | `content-guidelines.md` |
| Figma URL or screenshot | `figma-mcp-workflow.md` + `figma-component-mapping.md` |
| Component props and examples | `component-inventory.md` |
| ThoughtSpot product context | `product-knowledge.md` |

### Pre-implementation gate

Before writing any code, the AI answers four mandatory questions:

1. Does a Radiant component already exist for this?
2. Does the target component's CSS have overrides that need handling?
3. Is the icon name and size valid? (`xs` `s` `m` `l` only)
4. Does the UI text use any forbidden words?

This catches the most common mistakes before a single line is written.

### Context clearing

After completing a full Tier 2 build, the system suggests clearing context (`/compact` in Claude Code) before continuing. A full build can accumulate a lot of history — the next task shouldn't inherit it.

The same rules work across tools — `.cursor/rules/` for Cursor, `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code. You don't need to configure anything.

## Built-in skills and commands

Radiant Play ships with slash commands you can run directly in Claude Code (or describe in any AI tool). These are in `.claude/commands/`.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/explore [scope]` | Suspends Radiant constraints for freeform exploration. Use when you want to try shadcn, Tailwind, custom CSS, or any direction outside the design system. The rest of the prototype stays Radiant-compliant. Example: `/explore shadcn form components` |
| `/radiant-check [prototype]` | Runs a compliance health check on a prototype. Shows what's using the design system correctly, what's been customised, what's hardcoded, and where easy improvements exist. Non-blocking — it's a status check, not a gate. |
| `/new-prototype [Name]` | Scaffolds a new prototype folder with the correct structure, registers it, and pulls the latest from main first. Same as `npm run new-prototype` but with AI guidance through the setup. |
| `/project-status` | Opens a local HTML dashboard showing branches, forks, plans, worktrees, and divergence vs main/staging/upstream. Pure shell — no AI tokens used. |
| `/check-upstream` | Shows what has changed in the upstream Radiant Play repo since your last sync — new components, updated patterns, removals. Read-only, nothing merges. |
| `/sync-upstream` | Merges the latest upstream changes into your fork. Saves your in-progress work first, then syncs safely. |
| `/fork-status` | Reports on all downstream designer forks — which are up to date, which are behind, and what needs attention. |

**Two automated hooks also run in the background (Claude Code only):**

- **Convention recovery** — After every `/compact`, the five critical Radiant conventions are re-injected automatically so the AI never drifts after a context reset.
- **Liveboard requirements gate** — When it detects a new Liveboard build, it pauses and asks four targeted questions (mode, interactions, tile types, data) before loading any canvas rules. This prevents loading 600 lines of drag-and-resize spec for a view-only dashboard.

## Tips for better AI output

| Tip | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Name specific components | "Use a Modal with a SearchInput and Checkbox list" |
| Describe the layout | "Sidebar on the left, main content on the right with a header" |
| Describe interactions | "Clicking a row opens a slide-in detail panel" |
| Reference a Figma URL | Paste a figma.com URL and the AI maps it to Radiant components |
| Reference an existing prototype | "Similar layout to the AdminGroups wizard" |
| Batch visual tweaks | Send all changes in one message — cheaper than one at a time |

---

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server at localhost:5173 |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run build:strict` | TypeScript check + production build |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript only, no build |
| `npm run new-prototype Name` | Scaffold a new prototype folder |

---

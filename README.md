## What is This?

**Radiant Play** is a fork-ready repository for ThoughtSpot designers to build interactive prototypes that look and feel like the real product. It ships with 73+ Radiant UI components, design tokens, mock data, and AI rules — so you can describe a UI and get working code in seconds.

**Live site:** [radiantplay.vercel.app](https://radiantplay.vercel.app) *(ThoughtSpot internal)*

**How it works:**
1. Fork this repository
2. Open in Cursor IDE — AI rules load automatically
3. Describe your UI or paste a Figma screenshot
4. AI generates code using Radiant components
5. Preview your interactive prototype in the browser

## Quick Start

### New to this project? Read the full setup guide first:
- [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) — **start here** if you're new to Git and code (visual explainers with diagrams)
- [FORK-WORKFLOW.md](FORK-WORKFLOW.md) — fork-based setup for designers (recommended)
- [SETUP-GUIDE.md](SETUP-GUIDE.md) — detailed step-by-step guide

### Minimal setup

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub or Galaxy, then clone your fork:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/radiantplay.git
cd radiantplay
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Create a prototype

```bash
npm run new-prototype MyPrototype
```

Then open `src/prototypes/MyPrototype/index.tsx` in Cursor and describe your UI in the Chat panel.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server at localhost:5173 |
| `npm run build` | Build for production (skips type checking) |
| `npm run build:strict` | Build with full TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript checks without building |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run new-prototype Name` | Scaffold a new prototype folder |

---

## Repositories

This project is hosted on two remotes:

| Remote | URL | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|
| `origin` | `github.com/faris-ts/radiantplay` | Primary — Vercel deploys from here |
| `galaxy` | `galaxy.corp.thoughtspot.com/mohammed-faris/radiantplay` | Internal ThoughtSpot access |

To push to both after making changes:

```bash
git push origin main
git push galaxy main
```

## For Designers

### Recommended workflow

1. **Fork** the repo (Galaxy or GitHub) — see [FORK-WORKFLOW.md](FORK-WORKFLOW.md)
2. **Clone** your fork and run `npm install && npm run dev`
3. **Open** the `radiantplay` folder in Cursor — AI rules load automatically
4. **Create** a prototype: `npm run new-prototype MyPrototype`
5. **Describe** your UI to Cursor AI in the Chat panel or with Cmd+K
6. **Browse** existing prototypes at `/playground` for reference
7. **Explore** the design system at `/radiant` (components, tokens, icons, roadmap)

### Tips for better AI output

| Tip | Example prompt |
|-----|---------------|
| Name specific components | "Use a `Modal` with a `SearchInput` and `Checkbox` list" |
| Describe layout | "Sidebar on the left, main content on the right with a header" |
| Describe interactions | "Clicking a row opens a slide-in detail panel" |
| Paste Figma screenshots | Drop an image in the chat and say "Recreate this using Radiant" |
| Reference existing prototypes | "Similar layout to the AdminGroups wizard" |

### Key pages in the app

| Route | What it shows |
|-------|--------------|
| `/` | Home — links to DS and Playground |
| `/how-it-works` | How it works — overview of the workflow |
| `/radiant` | Radiant DS — components, tokens, icons, architecture |
| `/radiant/roadmap` | Roadmap — what's in progress and planned |
| `/playground` | Playground gallery — all your prototypes |
| `/playground/:id` | Individual prototype in full-screen |
